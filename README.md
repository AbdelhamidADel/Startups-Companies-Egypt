### What is a Software Startup?
A software startup is a new company that develops, sells, and distributes different types of software products or services. Most software startups aim to dominate a high-growth market on limited resources.

Since they’re new, they don’t have the operating history or background. Their lack of business history often poses some challenges in their operations. This may include funding and hiring top-level talents.

-In order to be more accurate and understand the relationship between the number of startups and time, this relationship has been divided into two organized periods

A- From 2000 to 2010

B- From 2011 to 2021
This division is logical and fair

It turns out that the number of companies in period A is 25 startups
As for period B, there are 51 startups
We find that the number of startups has doubled!

-Now we move on to the relationship between companies and the number of employees

The following figure illustrates this relationship in a simplified manner

### So is there a relationship between location and number of startups?
Of course, the location is a major factor, the location is important for companies
And we find that Cairo is one of the most places that includes companies that include 44 companies
It is followed by Alexandria with 18 companies, then Giza with 9 companies, then Hurghada is equal to Zagazig with the number of one company
